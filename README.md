This project will analyse various datasets regaring factors that influence the housing prices in the United States, represented by the Home Price Index. The approach starts with data processing and cleaning, the analysis and understandment of the the variables in the dataset, and will end in developing models to forecast this Home Price Index and to help us decide if it is a good moment to buy or sell. The objective is to be able to accurately predict the movement of this index based on the analysed variables. This data can assist in generating better risk assessments and better management strategies in order to improve the financial outcome for stakeholders tracking this index.

In the context of real estate investment, we employ a RandomForest Regressor to predict the Home Price Index (HPI), a continuous variable, which facilitates forecasting market trends and pricing dynamics. Simultaneously, a RandomForest Classifier is utilized to make strategic decisions on whether to `Buy` or `Sell` properties based on the categorical outcome derived from the percentage change in HPI. The selection of Random Forest models is due to their robustness against overfitting, capability to handle complex and large datasets, and their effectiveness in elucidating the importance of various predictors. This dual-model approach not only enhances strategic investment decisions but also supports economic forecasting, optimizing the overall investment strategy in the real estate market.
